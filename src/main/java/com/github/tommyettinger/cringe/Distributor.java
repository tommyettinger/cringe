/**
 * Different methods for distributing input {@code long} or {@code double} values from a given domain into specific
 * distributions, such as the normal distribution. {@link #probitD(double)} and {@link #probitF(float)} take a number in
 * the 0.0 to 1.0 range (typically exclusive, but not required to be), and produce a normal-distributed number centered
 * on 0.0 with standard deviation 1.0, using an algorithm by Voutier. The float and double versions also take inputs in
 * the 0.0 to 1.0 range, but the int and long versions {@link #probitL(long)} and {@link #probitI(int)} can take any int
 * or any long, with the lowest values mapping to the lowest results, highest to highest, near 0 to near 0, etc. Using
 * the suffixed probit() methods, such as {@link #probitF(float)}, is recommended when generating normal-distributed
 * floats or doubles if you want to keep the mapping of low to low and high to high.
 * <br>
 * All of these ways so far will preserve patterns in the input, so inputs close to the lowest possible input (0.0 for
 * probit(), {@link Long#MIN_VALUE} for normal(), {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE} for normalF()) will produce the lowest
 * possible output (-38.46740568497968 for probit(), -38.467454509186325 for probitD() and probitL(), or -13.003068 for
 * probitF() and probitI()), and similarly for the highest possible inputs producing the highest possible outputs.
 * <br>
 * There's also {@link #normal(long)}, which uses the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm">Ziggurat method</a> and does not preserve input patterns.
 * {@link #normal(long)} is a little faster than {@link #probitL(long)}, but the Ziggurat-based normal() might have some
 * small quality issues with some inputs that have patterns, like counters.
