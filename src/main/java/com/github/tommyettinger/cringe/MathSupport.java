     * is more likely to just be confusing.
     * <br>
     * Acklam's algorithm and Karimov's implementation are both competitive on speed with the Box-Muller Transform and
     * Marsaglia's Polar Method, but slower than Ziggurat and the {@link #normal(long)} method here. This isn't quite
     * as precise as Box-Muller or Marsaglia Polar, and can't produce as extreme min and max results in the extreme
     * cases they should appear. If given a typical uniform random {@code double} that's exclusive on 1.0, it won't
     * produce a result higher than
     * {@code 8.209536145151493}, and will only produce results of at least {@code -8.209536145151493} if 0.0 is
     * excluded from the inputs (if 0.0 is an input, the result is {@code -8.375}). This requires a fair amount of
     * floating-point multiplication and one division for all {@code d} where it is between 0 and 1 exclusive, but
     * roughly 1/20 of the time it need a {@link Math#sqrt(double)} and {@link Math#log(double)} as well.
     * <br>
     * This can be used both as an optimization for generating Gaussian random values, and as a way of generating
     * Gaussian values that match a pattern present in the inputs (which you could have by using a sub-random sequence
     * as the input, such as those produced by a van der Corput, Halton, Sobol or R2 sequence). Most methods of generating
     * Gaussian values (e.g. Box-Muller and Marsaglia polar) do not have any way to preserve a particular pattern. Note
     * that if you don't need to preserve patterns in input, then either the Ziggurat method (which is available and the
     * default in the juniper library for pseudo-random generation) or the Marsaglia polar method (which is the default
     * in the JDK Random class) will perform better in each one's optimal circumstances. The {@link #normal(long)}
     * method here (using the Linnormal algorithm) both preserves patterns in input (given a {@code long}) and is faster
     * than Ziggurat, making it the quickest here, though at some cost to precision.
